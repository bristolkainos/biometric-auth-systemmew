# Deploy
fly auth login
fly apps create biometric-auth
fly deploy
```

### **Google Cloud**
```bash
# Install gcloud CLI
# Download from: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

## 📁 **Files to Upload**

When uploading to any platform, include these files:

### **Essential Files:**
- `backend/` folder
- `frontend/` folder
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `requirements.txt`
- `package.json` (if exists)

### **Optional Files:**
- `models/` folder (pre-trained ML models)
- `database/` folder
- `README.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`

## 🎯 **Deployment Options Summary**

## 🚀 **Quick Commands**

### **Railway (No GitHub)**
```bash
# Windows
deploy.bat
# Choose option 2

# PowerShell
.\deploy_railway_no_github.ps1

# Manual CLI
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### **Render (No GitHub)**
```bash
# PowerShell
.\deploy_all_platforms.ps1 -Platform render
```

## ✅ **Success Checklist**

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Backend is accessible via HTTPS
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] Biometric capture works
- [ ] Admin panel is accessible
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] SSL certificates are valid

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Railway CLI not found**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Upload failed**
   - Check file size limits
   - Ensure all required files are included
   - Try web interface instead of CLI

3. **Environment variables missing**
   - Set them in platform dashboard
   - Check variable names are correct

4. **Database connection failed**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL format
   - Check if database service is running

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- **Start with Railway** - easiest no-GitHub option
- **Use web interfaces** if CLI fails
- **Test locally first** with Docker (optional)
- **Backup your files** before uploading
- **Check platform limits** for file sizes

## 🎉 **You're Ready!**

Your biometric authentication system can be deployed **without GitHub** using:

1. **Railway** (easiest)
2. **Render** (good alternative)
